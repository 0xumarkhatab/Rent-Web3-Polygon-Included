### Web3Rent
## Inspiration
Web3 is booming. Future is promising with the opportunities Metaverse will bring .But Nfts became the cake of rich since they were launched. Due to tremendous use cases of NFTs like 
-   Use in Games **(** sandbox and axie infinity  **)**
-   Attending the Event **(** using them for ticketing **)**
-   Host an Event **(** Host an event on virtual land NFT in metaverse **)**

Eveyone wants to use them but they are expensive. Also , if you want to launch your NFT collection on a website aliging with your choice , with nearly no-code, you will not find good platforms.

This was a calling moment for us. We took the pledge to provide Web3 assets renting in an easy way.
