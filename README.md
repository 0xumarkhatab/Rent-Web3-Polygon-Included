## Inspiration
Web3 is booming. Future is promising with the opportunities Metaverse will bring .But Nfts became the cake of rich since they were launched. Due to tremendous use cases of NFTs like 
-   Use in Games **(** sandbox and axie infinity  **)**
-   Attending the Event **(** using them for ticketing **)**
-   Host an Event **(** Host an event on virtual land NFT in metaverse **)**

Eveyone wants to use them but they are expensive. Also , if you want to launch your NFT collection on a website aliging with your choice , with nearly no-code, you will not find good platforms.

This was a calling moment for us. We took the pledge to provide Web3 assets renting in an easy way.

## What it does
We provide services for

-   Creators
-   NFT Holders
-   Developers
-   Users

#### Creators
Creators are those who have created an NFT Collection. For whitelisting and sale of their collection, we provide **Rentable Dapps** made by the best designers and developers in the space.

#### NFT Holders
NFT holders can **Rent their NFTs** for specific time in exchange of some money while still being the owner of them .Good way to earn passive income. 

#### Developers
They can build a website that does whitelisting and sale of the NFTs  by interacting with already deployed smart contracts. These deployed contracts are dynamic means that same website can be rented for different collections time after time. 
**Techical Example**
Same website can perform whitelisting for Bored Ape collection for 1 day and then Cryptokitties collection for 1 day. Websites perform same functions but Collections can be different.
**Build once earn lifetime**
#### Users
Users are People that can borrow NFTs and use them till specific time .
