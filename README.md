## Inspiration
Web3 is booming. Future is promising with the opportunities Metaverse will bring .But Nfts became the cake of rich since they were launched. Due to tremendous use cases of NFTs like 
-   Use in Games **(** sandbox and axie infinity  **)**
-   Attending the Event **(** using them for ticketing **)**
-   Host an Event **(** Host an event on virtual land NFT in metaverse **)**

Eveyone wants to use them but they are expensive. Also , if you want to launch your NFT collection on a website aliging with your choice , with nearly no-code, you will not find good platforms.

This was a calling moment for us. We took the pledge to provide Web3 assets renting in an easy way.

## What it does
We provide services for

-   Creators
-   NFT Holders
-   Developers
-   Users

#### Creators
Creators are those who have created an NFT Collection. For whitelisting and sale of their collection, we provide **Rentable Dapps** made by the best designers and developers in the space.

#### NFT Holders
NFT holders can **Rent their NFTs** for specific time in exchange of some money while still being the owner of them .Good way to earn passive income. 

#### Developers
They can build a website that does whitelisting and sale of the NFTs  by interacting with already deployed smart contracts. These deployed contracts are dynamic means that same website can be rented for different collections time after time. 
**Techical Example**
Same website can perform whitelisting for Bored Ape collection for 1 day and then Cryptokitties collection for 1 day. Websites perform same functions but Collections can be different.
**Build once earn lifetime**
#### Users
Users are People that can borrow NFTs and use them till specific time .

## Challenges we ran into
We faced many but here are few
#### Clarity of Project Idea
Not everyone is clear about the projet idea so as we. Initially we wanted to develop a platform where you can rent websites that are re-usable for different collections. But after some time, we had a look at renting NFTs and we have reframed our idea to include it too. 
#### Building a Factory version of Contracts
It was difficult for us to form factory versions for whitelisting sale creation and Rentable NFT smart contracts. But with the help of stackoverflow and github, we made it. Credits are given to the people whose code has helped us in smart contracts generation.
#### Ensuring Uniqueness of the Project
Uptil Dapp rent , our idea was really unique. But the inclusion of NFT renting made us somehow related to existing projects like reNFT. We need to be unique. We tried to ensure uniqueness by using ERC4907 standard. We wrote easy to understand well commented smart contracts that are fully transparent. Existing projects lack these features.  Also , our availability on Tron and Ethereum gave us an edge over others.
#### Un-availability of Laptop and Connectivity
One of the team members did not have the laptop and good internet connection also being a university student. He used to borrow laptop from his friends for the work. At times he had to sleep at 7 pm and wake up at 12 AM to do work on their laptops when it was free.But we both made it.
#### User experience and Decentralization
When we wanted to show available NFTs and Dapps for rent we wanted the storage to be decentralized but smart contract performs a bunch of stuff with the records. We could load available NFTs from smart contracts that is a slow process but the user exprience might suffer. So we took the concern of user experience and decentralization and achieving both with IPFS and filecoin's web3 storage.
